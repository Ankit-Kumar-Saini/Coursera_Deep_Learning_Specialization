    "# Assignment 1:  Neural Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of Course 4. Here, you will build an English-to-German neural machine translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention.  Machine translation is an important task in natural language processing and could be useful not only for translating one language to another but also for word sense disambiguation (e.g. determining whether the word \"bank\" refers to the financial bank, or the land alongside a river). Implementing this using just a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTMs can work for short to medium length sentences but can result in vanishing gradients for very long sequences. To solve this, you will be adding an attention mechanism to allow the decoder to access all relevant parts of the input sentence regardless of its length. By completing this assignment, you will:  \n",

    "Next, we will import the dataset we will use to train the model. To meet the storage constraints in this lab environment, we will just use a small dataset from [Opus](http://opus.nlpl.eu/), a growing collection of translated texts from the web. Particularly, we will get an English to German translation subset specified as `opus/medical` which has medical related texts. If storage is not an issue, you can opt to get a larger corpus such as the English to German translation dataset from [ParaCrawl](https://paracrawl.eu/), a large multi-lingual translation dataset created by the European Union. Both of these datasets are available via [Tensorflow Datasets (TFDS)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets)\n",

We have downloaded the data for you in the `data/` directory of your workspace. As you'll see below, you can easily access this dataset from TFDS with `trax.data.TFDS`. The result is a python generator function yielding tuples. Use the `keys` argument to select what appears at which position in the tuple. For example, `keys=('en', 'de')` below will return pairs as (English sentence, German sentence).  "

    "Notice that TFDS returns a generator *function*, not a generator. This is because in Python, you cannot reset generators so you cannot go back to a previously yielded value. During deep learning training, you use Stochastic Gradient Descent and don't actually need to go back -- but it is sometimes good to be able to do that, and that's where the functions come in. It is actually very common to use generator functions in Python -- e.g., `zip` is a generator function. You can read more about [Python generators](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/generators.html) to understand why we use them. Let's print a a sample pair from our train and eval data. Notice that the raw ouput is represented in bytes (denoted by the `b'` prefix) and these will be converted to strings internally in the next steps."

    "**Tokenizing the sentences using subword representations:** As you've learned in the earlier courses of this specialization, we want to represent each sentence as an array of integers instead of strings. For our application, we will use *subword* representations to tokenize our sentences. This is a common technique to avoid out-of-vocabulary words by allowing parts of words to be represented separately. For example, instead of having separate entries in your vocabulary for --\"fear\", \"fearless\", \"fearsome\", \"some\", and \"less\"--, you can simply store --\"fear\", \"some\", and \"less\"-- then allow your tokenizer to combine these subwords when needed. This allows it to be more flexible so you won't have to save uncommon words explicitly in your vocabulary (e.g. *stylebender*, *nonce*, etc). Tokenizing is done with the `trax.data.Tokenize()` command and we have provided you the combined subword vocabulary for English and German (i.e. `ende_32k.subword`) saved in the `data` directory. Feel free to open this file to see how the subwords look like."

    "but the gist is very simple. Our inputs have variable lengths and you want to make these the same when batching groups of sentences together. One way to do that is to pad each sentence to the length of the longest sentence in the dataset. This might lead to some wasted computation though. For example, if there are multiple short sentences with just two tokens, do we want to pad these when the longest sentence is composed of a 100 tokens? Instead of padding with 0s to the maximum length of a sentence each time, we can group our tokenized sentences by length and bucket, as on this image (from the article above):\n",

    "The model we will be building uses an encoder-decoder architecture. This Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) will take in a tokenized version of a sentence in its encoder, then passes it on to the decoder for translation. As mentioned in the lectures, just using a a regular sequence-to-sequence model with LSTMs will work effectively for short to medium sentences but will start to degrade for longer ones. You can picture it like the figure below where all of the context of the input sentence is compressed into one vector that is passed into the decoder block. You can see how this will be an issue for very long sentences (e.g. 100 tokens or more) because the context of the first parts of the input will have very little effect on the final vector passed to the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='plain_rnn.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding an attention layer to this model avoids this problem by giving the decoder access to all parts of the input sentence. To illustrate, let's just use a 4-word input sentence as shown below. Remember that a hidden state is produced at each timestep of the encoder (represented by the orange rectangles). These are all passed to the attention layer and each are given a score given the current activation (i.e. hidden state) of the decoder. For instance, let's consider the figure below where the first prediction \"Wie\" is already made. To produce the next prediction, the attention layer will first receive all the encoder hidden states (i.e. orange rectangles) as well as the decoder hidden state when producing the word \"Wie\" (i.e. first green rectangle). Given these information, it will score each of the encoder hidden states to know which one the decoder should focus on to produce the next word. The result of the model training might have learned that it should align to the second encoder hidden state and subsequently assigns a high probability to the word \"geht\". If we are using greedy decoding, we will output the said word as the next symbol, then restart the process to produce the next word until we reach an end-of-sentence prediction.\n",

This context vector is fed to the decoder RNN to get a set of probabilities for the next predicted word. The division by square root of the keys dimensionality ($\\sqrt{d_k}$) is for improving model performance and you'll also learn more about it next week. For our machine translation application, the encoder activations (i.e. encoder hidden states) will be the keys and values, while the decoder activations (i.e. decoder hidden states) will be the queries.\n",

This mask will be used internally by Trax when computing the softmax so padding tokens will not have an effect on the computated probabilities. From the data preparation steps in Section 1 of this assignment, you should know which tokens in the input correspond to padding.\n",

    "We have filled the last two lines in composing the mask for you because it includes a concept that will be discussed further next week. This is related to *multiheaded attention* which you can think of right now as computing the attention multiple times to improve the model's predictions. It is required to consider this additional axis in the output so we've included it already but you don't need to analyze it just yet. What's important now is for you to know which should be the queries, keys, and values, as well as to initialize the mask.\n",

We've placed several links to the documentation for each relevant layer in the discussion after the figure below.\n",

    "### Exercise 04\n",
    "**Instructions:** Implement the `NMTAttn` function below to define your machine translation model which uses attention. We have left hyperlinks below pointing to the Trax documentation of the relevant layers. Remember to consult it to get tips on what parameters to pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0:** Prepare the input encoder and pre-attention decoder branches. You have already defined this earlier as helper functions so it's just a matter of calling those functions and assigning it to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Create a Serial network. This will stack the layers in the next steps one after the other. Like the earlier exercises, you can use [tl.Serial](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Serial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Make a copy of the input and target tokens. As you see in the diagram above, the input and target tokens will be fed into different layers of the model. You can use [tl.Select](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select) layer to create copies of these tokens. Arrange them as `[input tokens, target tokens, input tokens, target tokens]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Create a parallel branch to feed the input tokens to the `input_encoder` and the target tokens to the `pre_attention_decoder`. You can use [tl.Parallel](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Parallel) to create these sublayers in parallel. Remember to pass the variables you defined in Step 0 as parameters to this layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Next, call the `prepare_attention_input` function to convert the encoder and pre-attention decoder activations to a format that the attention layer will accept. You can use [tl.Fn](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.base.Fn) to call this function. Note: Pass the `prepare_attention_input` function as the `f` parameter in `tl.Fn` without any arguments or parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5:** We will now feed the (queries, keys, values, and mask) to the [tl.AttentionQKV](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.attention.AttentionQKV) layer. This computes the scaled dot product attention and outputs the attention weights and mask. Take note that although it is a one liner, this layer is actually composed of a deep network made up of several branches. We'll show the implementation taken [here](https://github.com/google/trax/blob/master/trax/layers/attention.py#L61) to see the different layers used. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def AttentionQKV(d_feature, n_heads=1, dropout=0.0, mode='train'):\n",
    "  \"\"\"Returns a layer that maps (q, k, v, mask) to (activations, mask).\n",

    "    n_heads: Number of attention heads.\n",
    "    dropout: Probababilistic rate for internal dropout applied to attention\n",
    "        activations (based on query-key pairs) before dotting them with values.\n",
    "    mode: Either 'train' or 'eval'.\n",
    "  \"\"\"\n",
    "  return cb.Serial(\n",
    "      cb.Parallel(\n",
    "          core.Dense(d_feature),\n",

    "          n_heads=n_heads, dropout=dropout, mode=mode),\n",
    "      core.Dense(d_feature),\n",
    "  )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having deep layers pose the risk of vanishing gradients during training and we would want to mitigate that. To improve the ability of the network to learn, we can insert a [tl.Residual](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Residual) layer to add the output of AttentionQKV with the `queries` input. You can do this in trax by simply nesting the `AttentionQKV` layer inside the `Residual` layer. The library will take care of branching and adding for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6:** We will not need the mask for the model we're building so we can safely drop it. At this point in the network, the signal stack currently has `[attention activations, mask, target tokens]` and you can use [tl.Select](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.combinators.Select) to output just `[attention activations, target tokens]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 7:** We can now feed the attention weighted output to the LSTM decoder. We can stack multiple [tl.LSTM](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.rnn.LSTM) layers to improve the output so remember to append LSTMs equal to the number defined by `n_decoder_layers` parameter to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 8:** We want to determine the probabilities of each subword in the vocabulary and you can set this up easily with a [tl.Dense](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.Dense) layer by making its size equal to the size of our vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 9:** Normalize the output to log probabilities by passing the activations in Step 8 to a [tl.LogSoftmax](https://trax-ml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trax.layers.html#trax.layers.core.LogSoftmax) layer."
