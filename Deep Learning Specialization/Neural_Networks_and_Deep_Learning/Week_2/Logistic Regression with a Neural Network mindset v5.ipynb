    "**Interpretation**: \n",
    "- Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.\n",
    "- If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost). \n",
    "- A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.\n",
    "- In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: \n",
    "    - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.\n",
    "    - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.) \n"
